So long to all of my friends,
Everyone of them met tragic ends,
With every passing day,
I’d be lying if I didn’t say,
That I miss them all tonight
And if they only knew,
What I would say,
If I could be with you tonight
I would sing you to sleep,
Never let them take the light behind your eyes
One day, I’ll lose this fight
As we fade in the dark,
Just remember you will always burn as bright
Be strong, and hold my hand.
Time becomes for us, you’ll understand.
We’ll say goodbye today,
And we’re sorry how it ends this way
If you promise not to cry,
Then I’ll tell you just what I would say.
If I could be with you tonight,
I would sing you to sleep,
Never let them take the light behind your eyes.
I’ll fail and lose this fight,
Never fade in the dark
Just remember that you will always burn as bright.
The light behind your eyes…
Новая строка в песне
