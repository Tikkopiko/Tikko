So long to all of my friends,
Everyone of them met tragic ends,
With every passing day,
I’d be lying if I didn’t say,
That I miss them all tonight
And if they only knew,
What I would say,
If I could be with you tonight
I would sing you to sleep,
Never let them take the light behind your eyes
One day, I’ll lose this fight
As we fade in the dark,
Just remember you will always burn as bright
Be strong, and hold my hand.
